As it was suggested by the package, I managed to get the first 7-segment display to work and using the potentiometer I was able to show numbers between 0 and 9. However, When I added the second 7-segment display, I couldn't manage both displays to show different numbers like 45. Instead, whenever I use the potentiometer to change the numbers, it goes up or down by 11. In other words, both displays change at the same time and show the same number. For example, I can change the numbers from 00-11-22-33-44-...-99. I believe the wiring part of the circuit is correct as it was made based on the information of the resources that were provided in the package.
